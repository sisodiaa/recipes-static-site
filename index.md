# Abhishek's Cook Book

I love to think about, write about, and share and eat food.
My true passion, however, is helping others discover their love of cooking.
Like most of you, I am not formally trained in the culinary arts
I'm far from being a Chef, but I feel confident in my cooking skills and I know 
that you can feel the same way.
