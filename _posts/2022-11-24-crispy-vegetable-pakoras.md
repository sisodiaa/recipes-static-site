These vegetable pakoras are delicious. You'll love this recipe if you've ever had 
Japanese tempura-coated veggies. These pakoras are similar, but the spiced batter 
gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce, mint yogurt sauce, or sweet and sour sauce. 
Try this recipe with other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- ¾ cup water
- 1 quart oil for deep frying
- ½ head cauliflower florets
- 2 medium onions, sliced into rings

## Directions
1. Sift chickpea flour into a medium bowl; mix in garlic, salt, coriander, turmeric, 
chili powder, and garam masala. Make a well in the center; gradually pour water 
into the well and mix to form a thick, smooth batter.

2. Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

3. While the oil is heating, dip cauliflower florets and onion rings in batter to coat.

4. Working in small batches, fry battered vegetables in hot oil until golden brown, 
about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels before serving.
