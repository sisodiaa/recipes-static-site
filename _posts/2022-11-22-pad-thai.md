This is a traditional pad thai recipe used by a friend's mother. You can use chicken, 
pork, beef, tofu, or a combination. You may want to start with less pepper and work 
your way up.

## Ingredients
- 1 (12 ounce) package rice noodles
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 4 eggs
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- ⅛ tablespoon crushed red pepper
- 2 cups bean sprouts
- 3 green onions, chopped
- ¼ cup crushed peanuts
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges

## Directions
1. Soak rice noodles in cold water until soft, 30 to 50 minutes. Drain and set aside.

2. Meanwhile, heat butter in a wok; add chicken and sauté until browned. Remove chicken and set aside.

3. Heat oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into hot oil and cook until 
firm. Stir in chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Add softened noodles, sugar, fish sauce, 
vinegar, and red pepper; mix well until noodles are tender. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
Stir in bean sprouts and cook for 3 minutes.

4. Serve topped with green onions, crushed peanuts, and a wedge of lemon.
